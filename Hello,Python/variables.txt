Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python, so we'll make our first Python program a homage to their skit about Spam).


Variable assignment: Here we create a variable called spam_amount and assign it the value of 0 using =, which is called the assignment operator.

Note: If you've programmed in certain other languages (like Java or C++), you might be noticing some things Python doesn't require us to do here:

we don't need to "declare" spam_amount before assigning to it
we don't need to tell Python what type of value spam_amount is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam_amount to refer to a different sort of thing like a string or a boolean.



Function calls:. print is a Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, and putting the inputs (or arguments) to the function in those parentheses.

In Python, comments begin with the # symbol.
