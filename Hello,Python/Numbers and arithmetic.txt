Numbers and arithmetic in Python


spam_amount = 0

"Number" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that spam_amount is:

type(spam_amount)

It's an int - short for integer. There's another sort of number we commonly encounter in Python:

type(19.95)

A float is a number with a decimal place - very useful for representing things like weights or proportions.


type() is the second built-in function we've seen (after print()), and it's another good one to remember. It's very useful to be able to ask Python "what kind of thing is this?".

The // operator gives us a result that's rounded down to the next integer.
print(5 // 2) #2
print(6 // 2) #3
